            <p class="paragraph">Alexander could not be a better host. He truly cares about your Berlin/Germany travel experience and has many thoughtful suggestions and practical tips. I so enjoyed the historic swimming pool just a few blocks away where I could get in a swim. The neighborhood is delightful with some cool cafes and you're just a block from a key subway station, so it's easy to reach many different parts of Berlin.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Stefan’s place is very nice and quiet. The modern decor and the book collection made us want to just stay in. The bathroom is nice and clean and the bed is very comfortable. It’s conveniently located in central Berlin, right next to a park, Tiergarten, train stations, museums, cafes.... definitely a great option to stay if you are visiting Berlin.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">My stay in Berlin has been great. George's location was very cozy with top notch amenities that made my stay very comfortable. The entire flat was very clean and tidy. George was kind enough to give me many suggestions on where to go and what to see for my time in Berlin. He was also kind enough to print out my boarding pass and drive me to the airport. I would highly recommend staying here.</p>
